# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Open a pull request against `main`.
3. Run tests and linters locally (`pytest`, `pre-commit`).
4. Keep changes small and focused; include tests for new functionality.
5. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss design.

Maintain coding standards (Black, isort, flake8) and write clear commit messages.
